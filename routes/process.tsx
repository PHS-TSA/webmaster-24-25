      <h2>Locally Sourced Ingredients, Farm Fresh</h2>
      <p>
        We have partnered with multiple family owned Missouri farms to source
        our ingredients. This allows us to ensure no animals are harmed in the
        process and that our partners are following sustainable practices. By
        partnering with farms like this, we can deliver high quality food and
        promote more sustainable practices. For example, our Tempeh Bacon is
        sourced from Living Larder, a local, family-owned farm with the Soil
        Association organic certification.
      </p>
      <h2>Cooking Process: Organic Only</h2>
      <p>
        After our ingredients are sourced, we make sure they’re cooked in a
        fresh sustainable way. To do this we order fresh ingredients weekly to
        minimize/eliminate the need for preservatives. We also use specialized
        cooking methods such as fermenting to achieve delectable flavors without
        sacrificing our organic ingredients.
      </p>
      <h2>Seasonal Menu—Fresh Year Round</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the year, our menu changes to reflect the current growing
        seasons. For example, in the summer we may feature dishes with
        watermelon as it’s in season and being grown. While in the winter, we
        may feature dishes such as brussel sprouts that thrive in cold
        temperatures. This helps us ensure that everything served is fresh and
        organic.
